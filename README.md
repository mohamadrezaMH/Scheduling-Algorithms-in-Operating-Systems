Section 1: First Come First Serve Algorithm  
The First Come First Served (FCFS) algorithm is one of the simplest scheduling algorithms. It allocates the CPU to incoming processes in the order they arrive. A process that arrives earlier will be allocated the CPU sooner.

Steps of Implementation (Briefly Explained):  
In our implementation:  
1. First, we calculate the waiting time for each process using a loop, where the waiting time depends on the service time and the waiting time of the previous process.  
2. Since the order of execution depends on the arrival time of processes, we use another loop to calculate the turnaround time for each process, which is the sum of its waiting time and service time.  
3. During this loop, we also calculate the total waiting time and turnaround time. After the loop, the average waiting and turnaround times are computed.  
4. Finally, the results are printed.

Section 2: Shortest Job First Algorithm  
The Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm is a scheduling policy in which, among the processes in the ready queue, the one requiring the shortest execution time is selected to run.

Steps of Implementation (Briefly Explained):  
The primary difference in this implementation compared to the FCFS section is in two areas:  
1. Sorting processes based on their required service time.  
2. Using a nested loop to compare every two processes (bubble sort is used), followed by swapping two elements in a swap function.

This ensures that processes are sorted based on their service time, and the ones requiring the least time are executed first.

Section 3: Priority Scheduling Algorithm  
The Priority Scheduling algorithm assigns a priority value to each process. Processes with higher priority are selected for execution first. Processes with the same priority are scheduled in the order of their arrival.

Steps of Implementation (Briefly Explained):  
The only difference in this section compared to the SJF implementation is that the sorting is done based on priority values instead of service time.

Section 4: Round Robin Algorithm  
The Round Robin (RR) algorithm is one of the simplest scheduling algorithms for process management in operating systems. It assigns time slices (quantum) equally and cyclically to each process, ensuring that all processes are executed fairly. Processes are executed in a cyclic order, and if a process doesn’t complete within its time slice, it is moved to the end of the ready queue.

Steps of Implementation (Briefly Explained):  
This section differs significantly from the previous ones:  
1. A while loop is used to track the elapsed time until it equals the total execution time required for all processes.  
2. Inside the loop, we first check if a process has finished execution. If it has, we move to the next process.  
3. If the remaining time for the current process is greater than the quantum, the process is executed for the quantum, and we move to the next process.  
4. If the remaining time is less than the quantum, the process is executed and completed.  
5. After the loop, the results are printed.

Choosing the Right Algorithm  

First Come First Serve (FCFS):  
- Scenario: Suitable when there’s no need for prioritization and processes arrive sequentially.  
- Advantages:  
  - Simple and easy to implement.  
  - Good for batch or non-interactive systems.  
- Disadvantages:  
  - High waiting time for long processes.  
  - Not suitable for interactive systems.

Shortest Job First (SJF):  
- Scenario: Ideal when minimizing turnaround time is crucial, and service times are known in advance.  
- Advantages:  
  - Minimizes average waiting time.  
  - Efficient for batch processing.  
- Disadvantages:  
  - Requires knowledge of service times, which may not always be available.

Priority Scheduling:  
- Scenario: Useful when processes have different levels of importance (e.g., real-time tasks, system processes, user applications).  
- Advantages:  
  - Enables prioritization based on importance.  
  - Suitable for real-time systems.  
- Disadvantages:  
  - Can cause starvation for lower-priority processes.

Round Robin (RR):  
- Scenario: Suitable when fairness and responsiveness are essential (e.g., time-sharing systems).  
- Advantages:  
  - Fairly allocates CPU time among processes.  
  - Good for interactive systems.  
- Disadvantages:  
  - High context switching overhead.  
  - May not be efficient for long processes.

Conclusion:  
The choice of a scheduling algorithm depends on the system's requirements, workload, and characteristics. No single algorithm is universally the best; each has its strengths and is optimal for specific scenarios.
